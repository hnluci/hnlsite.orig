- title: "Attention selectively modulates cortical entrainment in different regions of the speech spectrum."
  image: Attention_selectively.jpg
  description: Recent studies have uncovered a neural response that appears to track the envelope of speech, and have shown that this tracking process is mediated by attention. It has been argued that this tracking reflects a process of phase-locking to the fluctuations of stimulus energy, ensuring that this energy arrives during periods of high neuronal excitability.

  description: The modulation of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) by attention was studied in detail using 15 “tag” frequencies in the range of 2.5–20 Hz. The stimuli were two series of random disc search arrays superimposed on two concentric color-marked annuli respectively.

- title: "Internal and external neural synchronization during conscious perception"
  image: placeholder.png
  description: Binocular rivalry is a useful experimental paradigm to investigate aspects of neocortical dynamics related to conscious perception. Frequency-tagged EEG responses to a sine-flickered visual stimulus were contrasted between episodes of perceptual dominance, i.e., conscious perception of that stimulus and perceptual nondominance, i.e., conscious perception of a rival stimulus presented at a different frequency to the other eye.

  image: placeholder.png
  description: In binocular rivalry, the observer views two incongruent images, one through each eye, but is conscious of only one image at a time. The image that is perceptually dominant alternates every few seconds. We used this phenomenon to investigate neural correlates of conscious perception.

- title: "Bayesian estimates of error bounds for EEG source imaging"
  image: placeholder.png
  description: Bayesian methods can be used to specify prior information to constrain the possible source solutions. We show that Bayesian analysis can also provide a means for characterizing system noise levels, estimating the "error bars" surrounding source localization results, and estimating the information about brain processes conveyed by dense sensor array electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.

  description: In binocular rivalry, a subject views two incongruent stimuli through each eye but consciously perceives only one stimulus at a time, with a switch in perceptual dominance every few seconds.

We embed this model in moderate noise, typical of the context presented in real neocortex, using PATHINT, a non-Monte-Carlo path-integral algorithm that is particularly adept in handling nonlinear Fokker-Planck systems.
